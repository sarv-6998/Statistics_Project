Title: Study on the Effect of Environmental Factors on Recalling Capacity

Objective: Investigated the impact of light intensity, sound intensity, and gender on students' recalling ability.
Methodology: Conducted a three-way ANOVA analysis to evaluate main effects and interaction effects of environmental factors on recall performance and test behavior.

Key Findings:
Significant Factors: Light intensity, sound intensity, and gender significantly influenced recalling capacity.
Interaction Effects: Combined effects of light intensity and sound intensity, as well as three-way interactions (light, sound, and gender), were statistically significant.
Non-Significant Results: No significant relationship found between environmental factors and the number of pauses taken during tests.
Tools Used: Statistical analysis in R (e.g., ANOVA).

Applications: Findings provide insights into optimizing learning environments for better cognitive performance.
